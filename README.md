# GeoTweet_Phrase_Prompter
This script asks for a lat/lon, then finds nearby tweets. These tweets are then used as a prompt in order to influence an author's text.

This is a more advanced tool; therefore, I will not walk you through how to install it. 
Please read about creating your own twitter API access tokens.
1. open scrape_geotweet.py and insert your access tokens.
2. first choice: use default locations, or change the radius or put entirely new lat/lons; choice is yours.
3. count; how many prompts do you want (up to 100); I like 10.
4. when the program prompts you with "analyze", if you write nothing and press enter you get any tweets from the geo-area.
5. if you instead write "bay" e.g., you'll get tweets that contain that keyword
6. when prompted by select, insert some language
7. and so forth and so on until you build up a text
8. then type space and return a few times and you will have your text returned to you
